Consumer rights protect buyers of goods and services from unfair practices.

Basic consumer rights include:
- Right to safety
- Right to information
- Right to choose
- Right to seek redressal

If a consumer receives a defective or damaged product, they can raise a complaint with the seller or service provider.

Consumers can also approach consumer helplines and forums for grievance redressal.
